In the customer role, products can be added to the cart, and the profile page is accessible. The admin role allows for dropping, updating, and adding product information. Additionally, admins can view graphs of sales.
# Getting Started with Create React App

To set up a React project, you can follow these steps:

Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from the Node.js official website.

Create React App: The easiest way to set up a new React project is by using Create React App. Open your terminal and run the following command to install it globally:
npm install -g create-react-app
Create a New Project: Once Create React App is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to create your new React project and run the following command:npx create-react-app my-react-app
Replace my-react-app with the name of your project.

Navigate to Project Directory: After the project is created, navigate to your project directory:cd my-react-app
npm start
This command will start a development server and open your React app in your default web browser. You can start coding your React components in the src directory.npm run build
Version Control with Git: Initialize a git repository in your project directory to track changes:git init
